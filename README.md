## To-Do List App

### Overview
This is a simple command-line based To-Do List application written in C++. The application allows users to add tasks with descriptions, generates a unique identifier for each task (a random number between 1 and 100), and enables users to mark tasks as done or not done. This project is ideal for those looking to practice basic C++ programming, including handling user input, generating random numbers, and managing a list of tasks.

### Features
- **Add Task**: Users can add a new task by providing a description. Each task is assigned a unique identifier (random number from 1 to 100).
- **List Tasks**: Displays the list of tasks with their descriptions, identifiers, and status (done or not done).
- **Mark Task as Done**: Allows users to mark a specific task as completed.

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)

### Usage
1. **Add a Task**: 
   - Input a task description when prompted.
   - The app will generate and display a unique identifier for the task.

2. **List All Tasks**: 
   - The app will display all tasks with their descriptions, identifiers, and status.

3. **Complete a Task**: 
   - Enter the identifier of the task you want to mark as done.
   - The task status will be updated accordingly.
